# My Portfolio

## Description

My first portfolio with my name, a recent photo placeholder (to be replaced with a professional portrait), and jump-to links to sections about me, my work with links to deployed projects and upcoming project placeholders, and my contact information with links.

This project has a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
